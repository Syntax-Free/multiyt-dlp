  <b>Multiyt-dlp</b> is the definitive high-velocity GUI for the legendary <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>. 
  <br />
  Built with <b>Rust</b> and <b>Tauri</b> because I wanted a masterpiece, but didn't want to write the code myself.

## ⚡ The Vibe-Powered Engine

### 🚀 Total Network Domination
*   **Massive Concurrency:** I don't wait for progress bars. Download entire playlists simultaneously. If your router catches fire, that’s a hardware issue.
*   **Rust-Tier Stability:** Leveraging a language I don't understand to provide performance I definitely deserve.
*   **Smart Queuing:** The AI manages the bandwidth so I don't have to.

### 🎛️ Total Control (No configuring required)
*   **The Archive:** It tracks what I’ve downloaded. If I try to download the same thing twice, the app judges me.
*   **Audiophile Presets:** FLAC, MP3, or 4K Video. One click. I don’t deal with codecs.
*   **Metadata Injection:** Auto-embeds thumbnails and tags. My files look professional even if my workflow isn't.

### 🎨 The "Phony Stark" Aesthetic
*   **Cyber-Glass UI:** A futuristic interface designed to hide the fact that I’m coding in my bedroom.
*   **State Awareness:** Visual indicators for when the app is "Dying."
*   **Syn Squad Integration:** The UI actually respects the intern (sometimes).
